# To Be, or Not To Be

Java "program" parodying Hamlet's "To be, or not to be" speech, written for an English 12 assignment.

No, it is not actually an executable Java program, nor was it ever intended to be.

## Reference

> To be, or not to be? That is the question—  
Whether ’tis nobler in the mind to suffer  
The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,  
Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,  
And, by opposing, end them? To die, to sleep—  
No more—and by a sleep to say we end  
The heartache and the thousand natural shocks  
That flesh is heir to—’tis a consummation  
Devoutly to be wished! To die, to sleep.  
To sleep, perchance to dream—ay, there’s the rub,  
For in that sleep of death what dreams may come  
When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,  
Must give us pause. There’s the respect  
That makes calamity of so long life.  
-- _Hamlet_ by William Shakespeare, Act 1, Scene 1, Lines 57-70
